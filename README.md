# HRPS
HRPS (Hotel Reservation and Payment System) was a Java project that my team and I made during university.  
At the time, there was the Covid19 outbreak and school was affected. So, during the long break, I decide to expand on this project.

# Different HRPS projects
| Project Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [First HRPS App](https://github.com/Muhazerin/cz2002-Assignment) | The very first HRPS my team made when we were in university |
|[HRPS Redefined](https://github.com/Muhazerin/HRPS-Redefined)|A better version of the HRPS App that I made during the lockdown. In this version, I try to apply all the SOLID principles|
|[HRPS Redefined with Dagger 2](https://github.com/Muhazerin/HRPS-Redefined-with-Dagger2)|Dagger 2 framework was added to handle the dependency injections|
|[HRPS Redefined with Dagger 2 and JDBC](https://github.com/Muhazerin/HRPS-Redefined-Dagger2-JDBC)|The database is changed to MySQL instead to txt file|
